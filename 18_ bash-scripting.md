## Bash Scripting

- Write a script in a file and save it
- Make the script executable using chmod
- Verify that shell can find the script


### Shebang
The first line of script should read:

```bash
#!/user/bash
```

### Executing the script
We can execute the script manually like this:

```bash
bash pathToFile
```

For example:

```bash
bash ~/script/greet
```

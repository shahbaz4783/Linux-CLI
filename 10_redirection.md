## Standard Streams

Standard streams are comminication channels between a computer program and its environment.

They are:

- Standard Input
- Standard Output
- Standard Error

1. `Standard Output`:
It is a place to which a program or command send information.

2. `Standard Input`:
   It is where a program or command gets its input. By default a shell directs standard input from keyboard. The input infomation could come from a keyboard, a file, or even from another command.

3. `Standard Error`:
   Command and program also have destination to send error, which is standard error. By default, the shell directs standard error information to the screen for us to read, but we can change that destination if needed.
